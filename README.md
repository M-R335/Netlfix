## Overview

This project is a Netflix clone built using Angular 17 and the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. It integrates movie data, including images and details, from the TMDB API to provide a visually appealing and functional clone of the popular streaming service, Netflix. This project helped deepen my understanding of API integration within an Angular framework, and I gained valuable experience in fetching and displaying dynamic content.

## Features

- **TMDB API Integration:** Fetches movie data such as images, titles, and overviews from the TMDB API.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and visually similar to Netflix.
- **Dynamic Content:** Displays dynamic movie content fetched from the API in a structured and user-friendly manner.
- **Custom Scrollbars:** Styled scrollbars to match the subtle and sleek look of Netflix.

## Learning Experience

This project provided an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in the following areas:

- **API Integration:** Understanding how to fetch and display data from an external API within an Angular application.
- **State Management:** Using Angular's state management features to manage and update UI components dynamically.
- **Responsive Design:** Creating a responsive and visually appealing UI that resembles a real-world application.
- **Advanced Angular Features:** Utilizing Angular 17 features such as signals, computed properties, and more for better performance and code readability.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by a tutorial from a project named by Cyril from CodeCake. It was a great resource that provided valuable insights and guidance on building a Netflix clone using modern web development practices.

## Acknowledgements
